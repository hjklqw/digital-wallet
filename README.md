An MVP of a Digital Wallet/Online banking system, created in around three days.

This project was made for the purpose of sharing code style and organization rather than being an actual app for use, and thus uses a fake database.

## Available Actions

- Login/Logout
- Register
- View wallet dashboard (current balance)
- View transaction history
- Create new transaction
- Change account settings

### Placeholder Pages

- Homepage
- Shared fake page for a few header links

## Existing data

**Username**: user1  
**Password**: user1

Has three transactions, all of which have randomly assigned numbers. For accurate transaction values, create a new transaction.

## Credits

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
